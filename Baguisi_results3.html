        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>The study found that the combination of jackfruit sap and fermented rice water was effective in attracting and trapping houseflies. The adhesive properties of the jackfruit sap prevented flies from escaping, while the sour smell of fermented rice water successfully attracted them. The results indicate that the fly trap can reduce fly presence in poultry farm environments.</p>
